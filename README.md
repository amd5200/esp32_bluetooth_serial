# esp32_bluetooth_serial
I use two ESP32s, one of which communicates with my phone via Bluetooth, and then uses the CLI to control the other ESP32, which has the ESP32 Marauder firmware flashed on it, via serial communication.

The ESP32 program responsible for communication is a serial communication program generated by AI.
